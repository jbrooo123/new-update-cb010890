            Olive ridley sea turtle 
        </h1>
        <p>
            The olive ridley sea turtle may have been first described as Testudo mydas minor by Georg Adolf Suckow in 1798. It was later described and named Chelonia multiscutata by Heinrich Kuhl in 1820. Still later, it was described and named Chelonia olivacea by Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz in 1829. The species was placed in the subgenus Lepidochelys by Leopold Fitzinger in 1843. After Lepidochelys was elevated to full genus status, the species was called Lepidochelys olivacea by Charles Frédéric Girard in 1858. Because Eschscholtz was the first to propose the specific epithet olivacea, he is credited as the binomial authority or taxon author in the valid name Lepidochelys olivacea (Eschscholtz, 1829). The parentheses indicate that the species was originally described in a different genus.
            <br>

            The generic name, Lepidochelys, is derived from the Greek words lepidos, meaning scale, and chelys, which translates to turtle. This could possibly be a reference to the supernumerary costal scutes characteristic of this genus. The etymology of the English vernacular name "olive" is somewhat easier to resolve, as its carapace is olive green in color. However, the origin of "ridley" is unknown, perhaps derived from "riddle". Lepidochelys is the only genus of sea turtles containing more than one extant species: L. olivacea and the closely related L. kempii (Kemp's ridley)
            <br>
            Olive ridleys are one of the most abundant species. Their omnivorous diet reflects a readiness to adapt to changing conditions. Olive ridleys can be solitary nesters or participate in arribadas. These mass nesting events may reduce the effects predators targeting nesting females, like jaguars, can have on the population as a whole. 

            Unlike highly migratory sea turtle species, olive ridleys typically remain within 850 km (459 nmi) of their natal nesting beaches throughout their lifetime. Thus, olive ridleys benefit most from the conservation measures enacted by the nations controlling these waters as per the UN Law of the Sea. 

            The varied tastes and habitats occupied by olive ridleys also put this species at grave risk of accidental capture. Olive ridleys chasing bait become hooked and entangled in various types of fishing gear. Substitution of J hooks with circle hooks can reduce rates of capture but additional innovations are needed to reduce fisheries bycatch of olive ridleys.
