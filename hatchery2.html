            <h3>Activities & Hatching Process Undertaken by Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery</h3>
            <p>
                By raising hatching rates, Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery continues to pursue its steadfast objective of protecting sea turtle eggs. In addition to merely hatching, they also take care of fishing-related turtles that are frail, injured, or paralyzed. The volunteers patrol the shoreline at night in search of turtles that are about to lay eggs. The volunteers transport the eggs from the beach to the hatchery once the mother turtles have finished laying their eggs. The development and hatching of the eggs could take 45 to 60 days. Baby turtles are swiftly released back into the water after hatching, usually in the late evenings to lessen bird and crab predation.
