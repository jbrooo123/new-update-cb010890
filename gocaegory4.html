  <h1>
    Leatherback sea turtle
  </h1>
  <p>
    Leatherback turtles have the most hydrodynamic body of any sea turtle, with a large, teardrop-shaped body. A large pair of front flippers powers the turtles through the water. Like other sea turtles, the leatherback has flattened forelimbs adapted for swimming in the open ocean. Claws are absent from both pairs of flippers. The leatherback's flippers are the largest in proportion to its body among extant sea turtles. Leatherback's front flippers can grow up to 2.7 m (8.9 ft) in large specimens, the largest flippers (even in comparison to its body) of any sea turtle.

    The leatherback has several characteristics that distinguish it from other sea turtles. Its most notable feature is the lack of a bony carapace. Instead of scutes, it has thick, leathery skin with embedded minuscule osteoderms. Seven distinct ridges rise from the carapace, crossing from the cranial to caudal margin of the turtle's back. Leatherbacks are unique among reptiles in that their scales lack Î²-keratin. The entire turtle's dorsal surface is colored dark grey to black, with a scattering of white blotches and spots. Demonstrating countershading, the turtle's underside is lightly colored.[20][21] Instead of teeth, the leatherback turtle has points on the tomium of its upper lip, with backwards spines in its throat (esophagus) to help it swallow food and to stop its prey from escaping once caught.
    <br>
    Over the past 50 years, the global population of leatherbacks has declined by approximately 40%. In some regions, the declines are staggering. The Western Pacific population has declined by more than 80% and the Easter Pacific population experienced declines of more than 97%.

    Historically, conservation efforts have focused primarily on protecting leatherback nesting beaches. For leatherback populations to recover, protections are needed at all life stages. In addition to nesting beaches, leatherbacks must also be protected in foraging habitats and along migration routes. Efforts to broaden conservation measures will require wider stakeholder participation and coordination in recovery efforts.
