<h1>
  Loggerhead sea turtle
</h1>
<p>
    The loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is a species of oceanic turtle distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the family Cheloniidae. The average loggerhead measures around 90 cm (35 in) in carapace length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately 135 kg (298 lb), with the largest specimens weighing in at more than 450 kg (1,000 lb). The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter plastrons (lower shells) than the females.
<br>
    The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean Sea. It spends most of its life in saltwater and estuarine habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg clutches and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.

    <br>
    Due to their extensive range, loggerheads have benefited from protections, resulting in a decrease in the direct consumption of adult loggerheads and eggs. These include the  SPAW (Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife) Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife),  CITES Agreement (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), and the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS).

    Fisheries bycatch and ship strikes are primary threats to loggerheads in marine environments. The use of Turtle Excluder Devices on bottom trawlers is improving the odds for loggerheads in the East Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. Additional monitoring at sea, and targeted partnerships with fishing stakeholders in geographic areas where loggerheads face the highest risks, could further improve conservation outcomes for this species.
