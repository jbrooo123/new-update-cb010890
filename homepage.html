            <br>
            <P>Sea turtle populations change from species to species. Some marine turtle species are lucky enough to have thriving populations. Where as some find it difficult to engage in critical discourse. Our oceans are home to an estimated 1,030,000 female sea turtles that are nesting. The estimated number of sea turtles left in the world is approximately 1,133,000, or one million, one hundred and thirty three thousand, assuming that 90% of sea turtles are female. </P>

            <h1>About the maginificient creature.</h1>
            <p>There have been marine turtles for 100 million years. They have a tail, a front flipper, a back flipper, and a head. The jaws of marine turtles can crush, tear, or bite depending on their nutrition. The environment affects the body temperatures of marine turtles since they have cold blood. With long flippers and shattered shells, they have the ability to breathe air and swim swiftly and nimbly.
            <br>
             Turtles are easily recognised by their bony, cartilaginous shell. This super-tough casing acts like a shield to protect them from predators some turtles can even tuck their head up inside their shell for extra protection!. Just like your bones, a turtle’s shell is actually part of its skeleton. It’s made up of over 50 bones which include the turtle’s rib cage and spine

            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Seven species of sea turtles live in the ocean and 243 species live on land, making up a significant portion of the aquatic life in the planet.Sri Lanka is also home to three different species of freshwater turtles, including the soft or flapshell turtle, the Parkers black turtle, and the Sri Lanka black turtle.Programs to save turtles are currently underway at Hikkaduwa, Bentota, and Kosgoda. 
            <br>
            One of the most important activities undertaken by volunteers, is the maintenance of the hatchery. Within the sanctuary, collected and rescued eggs can hatch safely away from predators in the haven of the specially constructed hatchery, before being released into the sea at night. A small number of turtles from each hatching group are kept at the sanctuary to join the ‘head-starter’ programme which hopes to increase the survival rate of turtles released into the ocean, while at the same time providing educational opportunities to locals and visitors.
