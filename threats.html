                  <p>Eight million tons of plastic make their way to the ocean every year. For many marine species, including sea turtles, plastics in our oceans can lead to threats of entanglement, habitat degradation, and ingestion. Discarded plastic bags floating in the ocean resemble jellyfish, a common food of sea turtles. If a turtle eats a plastic bag, it tends to clog the turtle's digestive system and result in the animal dying. There have been many cases of dissection showing plastic and other debris inside turtles' stomachs and intestines. Marine debris has caused mortality in all species of sea turtles. There have also been cases where sea turtles have been found with plastic straws in their noses, plastic bags or toothbrushes in their stomachs, or fish hooks stuck on their flippers. Plastic straws can be dangerous to sea turtles, too, because they are often mistaken for food. This can cause the sea turtle to choke or die of starvation because they feel full and do not eat, when they are actually full of plastic. Despite being small, plastic straws are among the top items that pollute the ocean. As previously mentioned, ingestion is also more likely to occur if the plastic resembles their typical food. Studies have found that turtles had a 50% chance of dying if they ingested more than fourteen pieces of plastic. </p>

                  <p> Artificial lighting is a threat to adult and hatchling sea turtles. Sea turtles use the brightest horizon as a guide to the ocean. This was created by celestial lights reflecting off the ocean’s surface. With human development along the coast, artificial light sources are growing in abundance. Unfortunately, these human-made lights are brighter than celestial lights, causing sea turtles to move toward them. A sea turtle not going in the direction of the ocean is referred to as a disorientation event. Disorientations lead to an increased risk of predation, exhaustion, dehydration, and/or injury. These events are often fatal. Disorientations can be caused by any light source that is directly or indirectly seen from the beach. Also, heavily lit beaches may cause an adult to have a false crawl. This is when the female decides the beach is not suitable for her nest and goes back to the water. False crawls cause exhaustion for the adult and may lead to her releasing her eggs in the ocean. This would be fatal to all the eggs.As awareness of the negative impact artificial lighting has on sea turtles has grown, there have been several large-scale conservation efforts by Marine Life programs and conservation groups to educate the public on turtle conservation. Communities situated on or near a beach have been warned of the effects excessive lighting has on sea turtles and there have been substantial attempts to darken beaches and replace harmful artificial lighting with turtle-safe lights. </p>

                  <p>Global warming is estimated to have serious effects on wildlife over the next few decades. There is evidence that sea turtles have already been affected. With the increase of temperature, polar ice has melted and has led to the rise of sea levels. This rise in sea levels has been a factor in the loss of beach, which for sea turtles means less nesting area. Global warming has been associated with severe weather, which could mean harsh and numerous storms that erode beaches and flood nests. As the overall temperature of the earth rises, so does the temperature of the sand, which diminishes the rate of hatchling survival. The temperature of the sand also affects gender, as higher temperatures have been shown to yield more female hatchlings. Changes in climate also influence currents and change the number and location of prey species. Water that is too warm can also cause coral bleaching, which is detrimental to reefs that are essential to certain species, such as the hawksbill sea turtle.</p>

                    <p>Sea turtles can become tangled in plastic and trash both on the shore and in the water. 
                        Discarded items such as fishing lines, balloons and plastic bags may also be confused for 
                        food and eaten by sea turtles, often resulting in injury or death.</p>

                        Hatching Turtles.</h3>
                    <p>Sea turtles are cute, and therefore tempting to touch and observe – but flashlights and 
                        people disturb turtles when they are nesting, or trying to nest, on the beach. Make sure 
                        to give nesting areas plenty of space, and do not disturb females as they emerge from the 
                        ocean looking for a place to nest. Also be conscious of where nesting areas are so that you 
                        can avoid trampling the hatchlings as they head to the water</p>

                    <h3>Turn Out Lights Visible From the Beach  </h3>
                    <p>Sea turtle hatchlings use light and reflections from the moon to find their way to the water at 
                        night. Artificial lighting confuses the hatchlings and causes them to head inland instead of 
                        out to sea – putting them in dangerous situations which can lead to death. Artificial lights also 
                        discourage adult females from nesting on the beach. Short of turning off your lights, you can 
                        also take measures to shield, redirect and lower the intensity of the lights on your property.</p>
