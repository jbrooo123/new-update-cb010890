  Green turtle (The largets sea turtle)
</h1>
<p>
 The green turtle is one of the largest sea turtles and the only herbivore among the different species. Green turtles are in fact named for the greenish color of their cartilage and fat, not their shells. In the Eastern Pacific, a group of green turtles that have darker shells are called black turtles by the local community. Green turtles are found mainly in tropical and subtropical waters. Like other sea turtles, they migrate long distances between feeding grounds and the beaches from where they hatched. Classified as endangered, green turtles are threatened by overharvesting of their eggs, hunting of adults, being caught in fishing gear and loss of nesting beach sites.Green turtles graze on seagrasses and algae, which maintains the seagrass beds and makes them more productive (much like mowing the lawn to keep it healthy). Seagrass consumed by green turtles is quickly digested and becomes available as recycled nutrients to the many species of plants and animals that live in the sea grass ecosystem. Seagrass beds also function as nurseries for several species of invertebrates and fish, many of which are of considerable value to commercial fisheries and therefore important to human food security.
 <br>
 Green turtles earned protection under many treaties and laws worldwide to address declines associated with direct consumption of meat or eggs. Although nest poaching has decreased due to community monitoring, illegal hunting of green sea turtles for personal consumption or sale within informal markets remains a challenge in many areas. Fishers likely to release other bycaught species of sea turtles may be reluctant to let green sea turtles go when they fetch a high price locally. Demand for green sea turtle meat may increase in countries where Catholicism is practiced as a substitute for other forbidden meats on Fridays during Lent.
