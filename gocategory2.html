          Hawksbill sea turtle
        </h1>
        <p>
     
 The hawksbill sea turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a critically endangered sea turtle belonging to the family Cheloniidae. It is the only extant species in the genus Eretmochelys. The species has a global distribution, that is largely limited to tropical and subtropical marine and estuary ecosystems.

 The hawksbill's appearance is similar to that of other marine turtles. In general, it has a flattened body shape, a protective carapace, and flipper-like limbs, adapted for swimming in the open ocean. E. imbricata is easily distinguished from other sea turtles by its sharp, curving beak with prominent tomium, and the saw-like appearance of its shell margins. Hawksbill shells slightly change colors, depending on water temperature. While this turtle lives part of its life in the open ocean, it spends more time in shallow lagoons and coral reefs. The World Conservation Union, primarily as a result of human fishing practices, classifies E. imbricata as critically endangered. Hawksbill shells were the primary source of tortoiseshell material used for decorative purposes. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) regulates the international trade of hawksbill sea turtles and products derived from them.

 <br>
 Hawksbill conservation efforts are aided by the species listing in Appendix I and II of CITES, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species. Consistent with this listing, all international trade in Atlantic and Pacific hawksbills was outlawed in 1977. Enforcement lagged with over 45 countries continuing to engage in the trade of hawksbill shells. With concerted effort, Japan reduced imports from 37,700 turtles to 28,300 in the 1980s and 7,075 in the 1990s. Japan finally stopped acquiring Hawksbill shells all together and retrained hundreds of artisans who had depended on the illegal trade for income. 

Other nations involved in the trade of hawksbill shells followed suit. Cuba decreased its official hawksbill fishery quota from 5,000 to 500 turtles. Illegal fishing continues to pose a threat to hawksbills globally, but in Cuba, as elsewhere, many local people now claim hawksbills are worth more alive as a source of income generation from a growing tourism industry.
